Changes into making an input file for ANNOVAR
Most important change is to add 1 to the reported positions of DELETIONS to be consistent with the Vardict outputs. 

Make anno input for indels works OK.
Running annovar on varscan indels also work OK.

For future work on: 
Combining the varscan and annovar outputs for varscan, make sure left join works ok and there are no NAs. 

Check the number of rows in the varscan output and annovar output, they should be the same.
Combining vardict and varscan for later. 

MAY 16 2022 (Monday)
Noticed that the input file for annovar indels (varscan) isn't correct. The addition doesn't work. Working on it now. - DONE.

Now Annovar should work on VarScan indels, and its output should be the same as the Vardict results. Now running Annovar on indels on batch 5.

Next steps:
1. Check the filter_varscan script to see if the previously written code can handle new the indels. Annovar might be outputting them in a slightly different format.

2. Change make_anno_indel file again to consider multiple indels that happen at the same location. previously i was excluding the indel with lower vaf.
This change is added! Now Ref and Alt alleles are generated based on the Cons seq. Rerunning ANNOVAR on VarScan indels. IT WORKS. 

MAY 18 (WEDNESDAY)
Sometimes we have cases like this from varscan:
chrX    44974800        C       +T/+T   87      298     75.25%  2       2       55      59      2.41754696291885
chrX    44974800        C       */+TT   87      10      2.53%   2       2       55      56      7.65118343560819
Same location with two different indels. The one with * is heterozygous, the other case above has both alleles impacted with the indel. I need to rewrite the ANNOVAR indel files to includes cases like this, which isn't many. I predict this is the final change I need to make in the ANNOVAR input files. I just finished editing, should work now. Rerunning making input files for ANNOVAR. YES IT WORKS OMG YAAAY. Running ANNOVAR in all batches now. 

Now working on the filter varscan script. Indels work ok. Now working on combining SNVs - SNV calls from VarScan and ANNOVAR.
VarScan analysis completed. SNVs and indels are classified correctly.
Now need to work on combining VarScan results with GATK and VarDict. 
And incorporating the WBC results - (CHIP must be present in both)

FOR LATER:
Working on combining results from variant callers.
